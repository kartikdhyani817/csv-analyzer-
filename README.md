# csv-analyzer-
This project is a command-line CSV Analyzer powered by local LLMs (like LLaMA via Ollama), allowing you to ask intelligent questions about your CSV files using plain English. It provides a simple yet powerful way to interact with tabular data without writing complex queries or uploading sensitive files online.
